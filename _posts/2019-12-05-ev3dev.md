# Using Python with the ev3
### Introducion:
Recently, I have been working on a project to use Python on the ev3dev platform. This is useful, because you can write complex programs for your robots. For example, you could [connect the ev3 to a PS4 controller.](https://by-the-w3i.github.io/2018/01/03/EV3-PS4-controller/) For me, I was woring on a SumoBot, a robot that battles with another, and tries to push it out of a ring. However, this approach will work with an sort of robot.
### Overview:
In this tuorial, I will show you how to:
- Download the ev3dev operating system for your brick.
- Connect your brick to your Wndows or Mac computer.
- Setup PyCharm on your computer.
- Connect to a GitHub repo.
- Sync the code to your brick.
### Materials:
You will need the following:
- A Windows or Mac with a working Internet and Bluetooth connection.
- An ev3 brick with various sensor and motors.
- A 2-16gb SD card.
- A way to put the SD card into your computer.</li>
### Getting started:
1. First, you will have to download the ev3dev boot image for the ev3 brick. This enables it to work with the Python programming language. You can find the image here.
2. Unzip the file, and move the contents to somewhere where you can easily access them.
3. Next, flash the image onto your SD card.
	> **Note:** to do this, use a program like Etcher, or Rufus, or use the command line. Make sure that you select the correct disk image.
4. Insert the SD card into the slot in the brick. Make sure that your brick is off.
5. Next, turn on your brick. It will flash wierdly and show lots of text. If it doesn't show a menu screen in 15 minutes, repeat steps 4-5.
6. Next, we need to connect the brick to your computer.
7. [View this website for instructions on how to connect your brick to the computer.](https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/connecting-to-the-internet-via-bluetooth/)
8. Connect to your computer with ssh:
- If you have a Windows computer download PuTTy, and launch it. Next type in `ev3dev.local`<br>![PuTTy](/static/assets/img/putty.png)
- Then, type `robot` as the username.
- If you have a Mac, then open Terminal, then type `ssh robot@ev3dev.local`
- Next type in `maker` as the password.
	> Having an error message? Make sure your robot is on, and that you have connected the brick. Also, make sure you have the correct username and password.
- You have access to your brick's inner workings! Try typing `fortune` to get a witty response from the computer.
- Your home folder is `/home/robot` this is where you are put when you connect to the brick.
	> **Some basic commands:**
	>- **cd {path}**: changes the current working directory to 
	>- **ls**: This shows all the files and folders in the current working directory.
	>- **cat {file}**: This returns the contents of the specified file.
	>- **nano {file}**: This opens an editor for the specified file. Press `ctrl+x` (`^x`)to save and exit.
	>- **clear**: Clears the terminal.
	>- **logout**: Logs out of remote connection.
	>-**python3 {file}**: Runs the specified python program.
- Right now, you can `nano` files into existence and run them from the terminal, but this is less than ideal, in the next section, you will set up PyCharm and Git.
### Setting up a Development Environment:
1. [Download PyCharm community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) (or the Pro version for that matter)
2. Open the file and install it to your computer.
3. If you have Windows, you have to configure Git, if you have Mac, skip to step 4.
	- Download [git-scm for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
	- Open and follow the install instructions with default options.
	- Open PyCharm, and push `ctrl + alt + s` to open preferences.
	- Goto `version control > git` and in the top file path put `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\git.exe`
4. Now, [get a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). They are free.
5. Goto [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository with the name `ev3`, select the option to include a `README.md`.
6. Open PyCharm.
7. Goto `Checkout from Version Control` and go to the GitHub tab. Sign in, and select your `ev3`.
8. Now, you have your code in PyCharm.

### Adding Code to the Program.
